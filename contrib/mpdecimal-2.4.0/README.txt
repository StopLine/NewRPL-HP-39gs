libmpdec
========

libmpdec is a fast C/C++ library for correctly-rounded arbitrary precision
decimal floating point arithmetic.  It is a complete implementation of
Mike Cowlishaw/IBM's General Decimal Arithmetic Specification. The full
specification is available here:

http://speleotrove.com/decimal/


libmpdec will - with minor restrictions - also conform to the IEEE 754-2008
Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, provided that the appropriate context
parameters are set.

libmpdec is the basis for the decimal module in Python-3.3.


The library has been tested on the following platforms:

   amd64:  Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, Windows

   ppc64:  AIX

   x86:    Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, Windows

   mips32: Debian
