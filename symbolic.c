/* COMPILING A SYMBOLIC:
 *
 * Compiler will switch to infix mode with the return value: OK_STARTCONSTRUCT_INFIX
 * And will return to RPN on ENDCONSTRUCT.
 *
 * In infix mode, the compiler sends OPCODE_MAXTOKEN to all libraries.
 * Libraries must determine if the token string starts with a token provided by the library.
 * Libraries reply with OK_TOKENINFO + MKTOKENINFO(precedence,nargs,length), with length=maximum
 * number of characters that the compiled token will absorb (length<=TokenLen)
 * At the same time, libraries must return the precedence of the compiled token they detected and
 * the number of arguments that this operator/function needs from the stack, and whether it is left
 * or right associative.
 * The compiler will choose the library that absorbs the most characters, will split the token
 * and pass the new token to the library to compile using OPCODE_COMPILE.
 *
